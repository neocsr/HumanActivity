# Tidy Data Set Codebook

## Description
This dataset is a summary of the original dataset from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

The first two columns describe a test subject and its measured activity.

The remaining columns are the features collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope from the smartphone.
All these features have been averaged by subject and activity, since there were several measurements for each activity for a particular subject.

The features have keywords that describe their procedence:

- *Acc*: Acceleromenter
- *Gyro*: Gyroscope

- *Time*: Time window average
- *Frequency*: FFT calculation over a time window

- *X* *Y* or *Z*: Axis in which the measure was collected

- *Std*: Standard deviation
- *Mean*: Mean of the measurement

- *Body*: To indicate body signals
- *Gravity*: To indicate gravity signals
